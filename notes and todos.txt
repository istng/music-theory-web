and fix warnings from sass (DO NOT FIX NPM UNTIL)

find some order for these:

find a better color palette for the modes -> color the buttons of modes, but color the backgounrds as the leading mode
change firebase domain/project name (maybe create a new project... but I dont like creating-deleting with google console)
change background, maybe add a title and an explanation
make a nice readme
start working on next steps
	harmonic and melodic minors
	showing blues scales
	graphic of modes by one note
	circle of fifths
